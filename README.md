# 👩‍💻 AI/ML Beginner Portfolio

Hi! I'm B.Prathyusa 👋  
I'm a beginner exploring the exciting world of *Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning*.  
This repo will track my *learning journey, projects, and experiments* as I grow my skills.

---

## 🌱 Current Focus
- Learning Python for Data Science & Machine Learning
- Practicing with NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Exploring basic ML models (linear regression, decision trees, clustering)
- Understanding the foundations of Deep Learning & Neural Networks

---

## 🛠 Tools I'm Learning
- Languages: Python  
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn  
- Notebooks: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  
- Version Control: Git & GitHub

## 📂 My Starter Projects
Here are some small projects I’ll be working on as a beginner:

1. 📊 *Data Analysis Project*  
   - Explore a dataset (like Titanic or Iris)  
   - Practice cleaning, visualizing, and summarizing data  

2. 🤖 *Basic ML Model*  
   - Train a model to predict housing prices or classify Iris flowers  
   - Learn how to evaluate accuracy  

3. 📝 NLP Mini Project  
   - Build a simple text classifier (spam vs. not spam)
